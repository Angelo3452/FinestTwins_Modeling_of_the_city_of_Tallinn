############## Code for the assignment of cells of workplace to each eligible individual in the synthetic population
The code assigns a cell to each individual in the synthetic population, while differentiating among NACE classes that are coherent among data sources (no gravitational element)
and ones that are not coherent (and are thus assigned exploiting a gravitational factor for the last mile).

It is possible to download the .RData and run the .Rmd code as they are, the working cells for the synthetic population of Tallinn will be assigned (when eligible)

Dataframe required as input
1. Distance.District: Dataframe including origins and destination cells with the corresponding distance, the district of the origin (Residenc_1), the district of destination 
(Destinat_1) and their land use classes (HRW, LRW, OW, MW).
2. Emtak.x.Dist_Red: Dataframe with eight columns as the eight districts of Tallinn (X1 to X8) and eleven rows for the Emtak classes that were found coherent among data sources.
The dataframe reports the share of work force employed in each district per each EMTAK class. EMTAK is the Estonian national equivalent of the NACE classification.
3. SyntheticPop: Dataset representing the synthetic population of the city of Tallinn, with the item WCell (Workplace cell) to be still assigned.
